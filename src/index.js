                      This is an example of a Contextual Modal Component. It
                      uses the Function as Child Component pattern to hold the
                      internal state of a Modal (opened/closed), provide a
                      number of methods common to opening and closing a Modal,
                      and a number of pre-wired components to make things even
                      easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This approach has the advantage of that it encapsulates
                      all of the common functionality of a Modal without forcing
                      opinions on you about how that Modal should be structured
                      or styled. The pre-wired components that it provides you
                      are designed to be minimal and easily customizeable, so
                      that full-control is always in your hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can use this component to create even simpler
                      abstractions, such as the Video Modal component shown
                      here. That component can contain all of the styling and
                      markup to display a YouTube video in a modal window, with
                      all of the properties set to a minimal set of attributes.
                      Then it can be dropped in anywhere in your application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Best of all, it does not rely on any sort of top-level
                      application state! Components like this can be built
                      without extra dependencies like Redux!
